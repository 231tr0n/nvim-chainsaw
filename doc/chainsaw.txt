**Requirements** - nvim 0.10 or higher. - Optional for
|chainsaw-smart-variable-identification| Treesitterparser for the respective
languages.

>lua

BUILT-IN LANGUAGE SUPPORT  *chainsaw-nvim-chainsaw--built-in-language-support*

- JavaScript (and supersets)
- Python
- Lua (with special considerations for `nvim_lua`)
- Shell (and supersets)
- AppleScript
- Ruby
- Rust
- CSS (and supersets)
- Go

Not every language supports every type of log statement. For details on what is
supported, see log-statements-data.lua
<./lua/chainsaw/log-statements-data.lua>. For languages like go, packages fmt
and time are to be imported manually by the plugin user.


  [!NOTE] For non-scripting languages like CSS, `nvim-chainsaw` uses statements
  such as `outline: 2px solid red !important;` that are the closest thing to
  logging you have.

USAGE                                          *chainsaw-nvim-chainsaw--usage*

The plugin offers various types of log statements. Bind keymaps for the ones
you want to use.

All operations are dot-repeatable.


LIST OF COMMANDS ~

>lua
    -- log the name & value of the variable under the cursor
    require("chainsaw").variableLog()
    
    -- like variableLog, but with syntax specific to inspect an object such as
    -- `console.log(JSON.stringify(foobar))` in javascript
    require("chainsaw").objectLog()
    
    -- inspect the type of the variable under cursor, such as `typeof foo` in js
    require("chainsaw").typeLog()
    
    -- assertion statement for variable under cursor
    require("chainsaw").assertLog()
    
    -- Minimal log statement, with an emoji for differentiation. Intended for
    -- control flow inspection, that is to quickly glance whether a condition was
    -- triggered or not.
    require("chainsaw").emojiLog()
    
    -- Sound-playing statement for audible debugging.
    -- Depending on the type of log statement, it is either a terminal bell
    -- (requiring the terminal) or a system sound.
    -- Inspired by https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41519046
    require("chainsaw").sound()
    
    -- create log statement, and position the cursor to enter a message
    require("chainsaw").messageLog()
    
    -- 1st call: start measuring the time
    -- 2nd call: logs the time duration since
    require("chainsaw").timeLog()
    
    -- debug statements like `debugger` in javascript or `breakpoint()` in python
    require("chainsaw").debugLog()
    
    -- prints the stacktrace of the current call
    require("chainsaw").stacktraceLog()
    
    -- clearing statement, such as `console.clear()`
    require("chainsaw").clearLog()
    
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    -- remove all log statements created by nvim-chainsaw
    require("chainsaw").removeLogs()
<

These features can also be accessed with the user command `:Chainsaw`. Each
option corresponds to the commands above. For example, `:Chainsaw variableLog`
is same as `:lua require("chainsaw").variableLog()`.

When using lua functions, `variableLog`, `objectLog`, `typeLog`, and
`assertLog` can also be used in **visual mode** to use the visual selection
instead of the word under the cursor.


  [!TIP] `variableLog` for `nvim_lua` uses a log statement that inspects objects
  and is designed to work with various notification plugins like `nvim-notify`,
  `snacks.nvim`, or `noice.nvim`. If using `snacks.nvim`, lua syntax highlighting
  is added.

SMART VARIABLE IDENTIFICATION ~

When the variable under the cursor is an object with fields, `chainsaw`
attempts to automatically select the correct field. Note that this feature
requires the Treesitter parser of the respective language.

>lua
    myVariable.myF[i]eld = "foobar"
    -- prints: myVariable.myField
    
    myVa[r]iable.myField = "foobar"
    -- prints: myVariable
<

Filetypes currently supporting this feature: - Lua - Python - JavaScript (and
supersets)

PRs adding support for more languages are welcome.


CONFIGURATION                          *chainsaw-nvim-chainsaw--configuration*


BASE CONFIGURATION ~

>lua
    -- default settings
    require("chainsaw").setup {
        -- The marker should be a unique string, since lines with it are highlighted
        -- and since `removeLogs` will remove any line with it. Thus, emojis or
        -- strings like "[Chainsaw]" are recommended.
        marker = "ü™ö",
    
        -- Highlight lines with the marker.
        -- When using `lazy.nvim`, you need to add `event = VeryLazy` to the plugin
        -- spec to have existing log statements highlighted as well.
        ---@type string|false
        logHighlightGroup = "Visual",
    
        -- emojis used for `emojiLog`
        logEmojis = { "üîµ", "üü©", "‚≠ê", "‚≠ï", "üíú", "üî≤" },
    }
<


CUSTOM LOG STATEMENTS ~

Custom log statements can be added in the `setup()` call. There are various
placeholders that are dynamically replaced: - `{{marker}}` inserts the value
from `config.marker`. Each log statement should have one, so that the line can
be removed via `.removeLogs()`. - `{{var}}`variable as described further above.
- `{{time}}`timestamp formatted as `HH:MM:SS` (for millisecond-precision, use
`.timeLog()` instead) - `{{file}}`basename of the current file -
`{{lnum}}`current line number - _.emojiLog() only_`{{emoji}}` inserts the emoji
- _.timeLog() only_`{{index}}` inserts a running index (needed to differentiate
between variables when inserting `timeLog` multiple times).

See log-statements-data.lua <./lua/chainsaw/log-statements-data.lua> for the
built-in log statements. PRs adding log statements for more languages are
welcome.

>lua
    require("chainsaw").setup ({
        logStatements = {
            variableLog = {
                javascript = 'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
                otherFiletype = ‚Ä¶ -- <-- add the statement for your filetype here
            },
            -- the same way for the other log statement operations
        },
    })
<


  [!NOTE] 1. The strings may not include line breaks. If you want to use
  multi-line log statements, use a list of strings instead, each string
  representing one line. 2. See superset-inheritance.lua
  <./lua/chainsaw/superset-inheritance.lua> for how language supersets (such as
  `typescript` inheriting from `javascript`) is handled.

HAVE YOUR FORMATTER IGNORE THE LOG STATEMENTS ~

A common problem is that formatters like `prettier` split up the log statements
into multiple lines, making them hard to read and breaking `removeLogs()`,
which relies on each line containing the marker emoji.

The simplest method to deal with this is to customize the log statement in your
configuration to include an ignore-comment: `/* prettier-ignore */`.

>lua
    require("chainsaw").setup {
        logStatements = {
            variableLog = {
                javascript = {
                    "/* prettier-ignore */ // {{marker}}", -- adding this
                    'console.log("{{marker}} {{var}}:", {{var}});',
                },
            },
        },
    }
<


  [!TIP] The log statement now needs to be a list of strings as line breaks are
  not supported, and the ignore-comment should include the marker for removal via
  `.removeLogs`.

SIMILAR LUA PLUGINS              *chainsaw-nvim-chainsaw--similar-lua-plugins*

- debugprint.nvim <https://github.com/andrewferrier/debugprint.nvim>
- refactoring.nvim <https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#debug-features>
- logsitter <https://github.com/gaelph/logsitter.nvim>

The other plugins are more feature-rich, while `nvim-chainsaw` tries to achieve
the core functionality in a far more lightweight manner to keep maintenance
minimal.
